## Define and create Kubernetes Service.
##
## Ref.: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service
#
service:
  ## Whether to enable session affinity or not. It is required by ingress.
  #
  enabled: true

  ## Choose the kind of Service:
  ##
  ## "ClusterIP" => Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable
  ##                from within the cluster. This is the default that is used if you don't explicitly specify a type for
  ##                a Service.
  ## "NodePort" => Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port
  ##               available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of
  ##               type: ClusterIP.
  ## "LoadBalancer" => Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
  ##
  ## Ref.: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types
  #
  type: "ClusterIP"

  ## Specify the external IP address for the LoadBalancer service. If your cloud provider supports
  ## specifying a static IP for the load balancer, you can set it here.
  ## Example:
  ## loadBalancerIP: "172.16.0.1"
  loadBalancerIP: ""

  ## Define the ports of Service.
  ## You can set the port value to an arbitrary value, it will map the container port by name.
  ##
  ## Custom NodePort example:
  ## ports:
  ##   http:
  ##     port: 8080
  ##     protocol: "TCP"
  ##     nodePort: "38080"
  #
  ports:
    http:
      containerPort: 8080
      port: 8080
      protocol: "TCP"

  ## Configure session affinity for to hit the same backend for the period specified in `timeoutSeconds`.
  ##
  ## Ref.: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#session-affinity
  #
  sessionAffinity:
    ## Whether to enable session affinity or not.
    #
    enabled: false
    ## The session duration in seconds.
    #
    timeoutSeconds: 10800

## Define Service Accounts for Pods.
##
## Ref.: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
#
serviceAccount:
  ## Whether to create service account.
  #
  create: true

  ## Define custom service account annotations.
  #
  annotations: {}
