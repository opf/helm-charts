  ##                a Service.
  ## "NodePort" => Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port
  ##               available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of
  ##               type: ClusterIP.
  ## "LoadBalancer" => Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
  ##
  ## Ref.: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types
  #
  type: "ClusterIP"

  ## Specify the external IP address for the LoadBalancer service. If your cloud provider supports
  ## specifying a static IP for the load balancer, you can set it here.
  ## Example:
  ## loadBalancerIP: "172.16.0.1"
  loadBalancerIP: ""

  ## Define the ports of Service.
  ## You can set the port value to an arbitrary value, it will map the container port by name.
  ##
  ## Custom NodePort example:
  ## ports:
  ##   http:
  ##     port: 8080
  ##     protocol: "TCP"
  ##     nodePort: "38080"
  #
