# Install OpenProject in development mode, that is without https and allowing writes
# to the container file system.

# Example: ./bin/install-dev -f ./examples/openproject-hpa-values.yaml

# You might need to run `helm dependency update` first
helm upgrade --create-namespace --namespace openproject --install openproject --set develop=true "$@" .
