# OpenProject Helm Charts

This is a self-contained Helm chart registry for OpenProject based on github pages
using helm's [chart-releaser](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) action.



## Installation

Please refer to our [documentation](https://www.openproject.org/docs/installation-and-operations/installation/helm-chart/) for instructions on how to install the OpenProject helm chart.

### Bitnami charts

Due to Bitnami's move to get rid of their free and public helm offering, we will need to find alternatives for the builtin packages (memacached, postgres). For testing purposes, we currently reference their legacy charts. Please note that they are not subject to updates nor security updates.

For production systems, we recommend you use their security offering, or alternatives (such as CNPG). We are interested in using these alternatives in our charts as well, feel free to provide pull requests to help us in that regard.

## GitHub package registry

We publish newer versions of this chart to the GitHub package registry: https://github.com/opf/helm-charts/pkgs/container/helm-charts%2Fopenproject


## Helm chart signing

We sign our chart using the [Helm Provenance and Integrity](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/provenance/) functionality. You can find the used public key here

-  https://github.com/opf/helm-charts/blob/main/signing.key 
- https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/CB1CA0488A75B7471EA1B087CF56DD6A0AE260E5
